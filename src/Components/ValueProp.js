        The R3al Meteverse producer's pass gives you the opportunity to create
        episodes, influence cast decisions and control the fate of Season 2!
        You'll also get exclusive early access to see the episodes of TRM and
        receive Airdrops throughout the series. These utilities include
        behind-the-scenes content like production storyboards, gifs from the
        series, audition submission forms and never-before seen production
        stills. We want you to see the added value that holding this NFT will
        give you, but most importantly we want you to create the story with us!

      <div className="rarity-title">HOW?</div>
      <div className="rarity-description">
        In the Producer's Room, contribute to Mad Lib style confessionals where
        you control the character and decide what they say. With our quick turn
        animation studio, the most popular choices will be brought to life and
        animated in days. Pass holders will also submit ideas in the producer's
        room for special episodes like the final episode Where Are They Now?"
        The submission will be voted on and animated. Even more, if your entries
        are selected for these special episodes, you will be credited at the end
        of the episode. It can be your wallet #, twitter name or ens name!
        Again, we want to reward your creativity and give the control back to
        you! Producer Pass holders will also decide on the city where Season 2
        takes place. Is it New York, Nashville, Miami or Nantucket? The country
        is wide open, and the location with the most votes will be home to the
        new cast. But that's not the best partâ€¦..

      <div className="rarity-title">GET YOUR CHARACTER ANIMATED!</div>
      <div className="rarity-description">
        There are two ways you can get your PFP character animated. If you are a
        holder of an NFT from one of the five OG communities our cast comes from
        and you're in the top 500 on our leaderboard, you could win a spot to
        have your character make a cameo appearance this season. You might even
        be able to voice your character yourself! The holders who meet the
        criteria will be asked to write in why they should be animated,
        describing their character's personality, while giving the producers a
        glimpse into the back story you've created. The community will choose
        one to be animated and make a guest appearance on the show. Examples
        will be posted when the time is right! The other cool way to get
        animated is by being in the top 500 on the leaderboard and submitting
        your licensable character to be on Season 2. That's right, we're casting
        next season's House Mates from this season's Pass Holders!
