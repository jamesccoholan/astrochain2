        <b>This Season:</b> If you are a holder of an NFT from one of the five OG communities our cast comes from,
         and you’re in the top 500 on our leaderboard, (more on that in a minute) you could win a spot to have 
         your character make a cameo appearance this season. You might even be able to voice your character yourself! 
         The holders who meet the criteria will be asked to write in why they should be animated, describing their character's personality. 
         The community will choose one character from each of the five original projects who will be animated and come to life on the show.<br/><br/>
         <b>Next Season:</b> The other cool way to get animated is by being in the top 500 on the leaderboard and submitting your character to be on Season 2. 
         It can be from any licensable community! That’s right, we’re casting next season’s cast from Pass Holders at the end of Season 1. 
         And Pass Holders decide on the city where Season 2 takes place.  Is it New York, Nashville, Miami or Nantucket? 
         The country is wide open, and the location with the most votes will be home to the new cast.<br/><br/>
         In addition to this first-of-its- kind opportunity, all pass holders can contribute to Mad Lib style confessionals where you control the character and decide what they say in certain episodes.
          With our quick turn animation studio, the most popular choices will be brought to life and animated in days.
         Producer pass holders will also submit ideas in the producer{"’"}s room for special episodes like “Where Are They Now?” The submissions will be voted on and the winners animated. 
         Even more, if your entries are selected for these special episodes, you will be credited at the end of the episode. It can be your wallet #, discord ID, twitter name or ens name!<br/><br/>
         Producers get exclusive early access to see the episodes of TRM and receive Airdrops from the series. 
         These include behind-the-scenes content like production storyboards, gifs, audition submission forms and never-before seen production stills. 
         We want you to see the added value that holding this NFT will give you, but most importantly we want you to create the story with us!
